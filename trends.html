                <p align="left"> The peaks of bike share use are at 8:00AM, noon, and 5:00PM. These are times when people are going to work, going to get lunch, or getting off of work respectively. The largest peak is at 5:00PM most likely because people are more willing to use bikeshare as a method of transportation without the rush of work. </p>

                <p align="left"> The graph below demonstrates the 
                        number of bikeshare use each day from July to March. 

                        We can see a downward trend during the fall season, 
                        but a slight upward trend during the start of the year. This steady trend towards a growth allows us to analyze that bikeshare use will most likely grow in the upcoming season. However, the timeframe of the data is short so it is hard to make accurate descriptions about the entire industry.</p>

                <h1 align="left"> On average, how long does each passholder user ride?</h1>
                <p align="left"> From this data, we can see that walk-up users and staff members ride each time for the longest. It could be that walk-up users use each ride the longest because they are either first time-uers or non-daily users. Thus, they are not aware of when they can find another bike. In order to make sure they have the bike to get to their destination, they keep that bike throughout their travels. Staff members could use the bikes to ride to work, which may be shown by their high average. Monthly and flex pass users have a relatively short average ride time. They may be more likely to start and end bike rides more often throughout one trip because they do not have to pay more for renting out another bike. Additionally, they know that bikeshare bikes are common throughout the city and they do not have to worry about getting back to their destination just because they ended the trip. </p>

            <div class="container text-center">
                <h1 align="left"> What are the total hours that each passholder types rode?</h1>
                <p align="left"> We can see that the majority of the bike share use is made by walk-up users and monthly pass users. The staff annual total hours are almost negligible, which makes sense since employees make up the smallest percentage of the entire market. Our largest market is the walk-up group. Although there are more monthly pass users than walk-up users, the walk-up users make up more of the total hour used. We can see that monthly pass users have shorter rides than walk-up users. Passholders in general may forget about their pass, or have had bad experiences in the first few days of the month and stopped using bikeshares. The flex pass is also very small and this may be that people forget about the pass since one purchase lasts one year.</p>
